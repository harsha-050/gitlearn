git hub alternatives -->gutbucket or gitlab
git repository --> a folder which is tracked by git
create folder(ex: gitlearn)
move to the folder in the terminal
git init --> to initialize a new git repository
git add folder_name
git add . 	--(allversions)
    (or)	-- to select which files to track the versions
git add file_name --(only the file file_name)
git commit -m "write message here" -- to save the changes made in file to git
git status -- to see status 
git log  -- to see the version history
IN git '.' is used for the current folder name
git checkout folder_name or file_name or . --> to discard changes from working area to previous commit(view)
git checkout commit hash -->to move to that version id(view)
git checkput branch_name -->to move to the branch with name branch_name (view)
git checkput commit hash file_name --> only changes in file_name are returned to version with given hash
git add file_name --> to add changes to the staged area
--> Files in which changes are made are added to working area
--> up on adding them changes are shown in staged area in the vs code
if we need to restore then after checking out, we need to commit that
create .gitignore file in the same folder and in the file write the name of files that need to be ignored to staged area
To link GitHub repo to a local folder
first create new repo in the new repositories
next in powershell go to folder which needed to be tracked and use git remote origin link_of_repo-->here origin is the name of the remote_nickname to the repository
to check the linkage git remote -v --> v means verbose -->meaning more details
push means to upload to GitHub and pull means to download from GitHub
next use git push origin branch_name--> here origin is the name of the remote_nickname to the repository
git add.
git commit -m "write message here" -- to save the changes made in file to git
(or)
(git commit -m "message" --amend)  --> this is for to delete the last commit and add the present changes to git
git status -- to see status 
git log  -- to see the version history
