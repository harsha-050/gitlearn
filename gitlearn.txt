git hub alternatives -->gutbucket or gitlab
git repository --> a folder which is tracked by git


create folder(ex: gitlearn)
move to the folder in the terminal								(MAKING A FOLDER INTO A GIT REPOSITARY)
git init --> to track the changes in the folder using git -- now this folder will become a new git repo-- that's it our version history can be tracked now with git

git add folder_name
git add . 	--(allversions)									(SELECTING FILES TO STAGING AREA)
    (or)	-- to select which files to track the versions
git add file_name --(only the file file_name)

git commit -m "write message here" -- to save the changes made in file to git			(SAVING VERSION HISTORY)

git status -- to see status 									(CHECKING STATUS OF COMMITS OF FILES)

git log  -- to see the version history								(TO VIEW THE VERSION HISTORY)					

IN git '.' is used for the current folder name
git checkout folder_name or file_name or . --> to discard changes from working area to previous commit(view)
git checkout commit hash -->to move to that version id(view)
git checkout branch_name -->to move to the branch with name branch_name (view)
git checkout commit hash file_name --> only changes in file_name are returned to version with given hash
git add file_name --> to add changes to the staged area
--> Files in which changes are made are added to working area
--> up on adding them changes are shown in staged area in the vs code
if we need to restore then after checking out, we need to commit that
create .gitignore file in the same folder and in the file write the name of files that need to be ignored to staged area
To link GitHub repo to a local folder
first create new repo in the new repositories
next in powershell go to folder which needed to be tracked and use git remote origin link_of_repo-->here origin is the name of the remote_nickname to the repository
TO remove the linkage of remote repository to local repo use git remote remove origin
to check the linkage git remote -v --> v means verbose -->meaning more details
push means to upload to GitHub and pull means to download from GitHub
next use git push origin branch_name--> here origin is the name of the remote_nickname to the repository
**git commit is to store the version history in the local git and git push origin master is to upload to the remote repository to the github**
to create a shortcut to git push origin master we need to use --> git push origin master --setup -upstream --> next time we can use git push directly , which will automatically reflects git push origin master
To sync changes to local repo from GitHub
	remote repos state in local computer wont update automatically.
	to update the state of remote repos, we need to do -- git fetch -- the remote repos state will be updated
	if the remote repo has any updates, to sync the local repo we need to use --git pull origin master-- now the local and remote repos(i.e in github) are in same state or in sync
	




**git push only pushes commits , the changes first need to the staged area from working area(git add .) 
git commit -m "message"
git push origin master
**

git add.
git commit -m "write message here" -- to save the changes made in file to git
(or)
(git commit -m "message" --amend)  --> this is for to delete the last commit and add the present changes to git or inother words to make a new commit and deleting previous one
git push origin master
git status --> to see status 
git log --all --graph --> to see the version history
